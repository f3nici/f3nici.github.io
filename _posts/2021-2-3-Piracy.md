## Why should I use a VPN? <a name="VPN"></a>
A vpn will hide your IP from other people torrenting the same file, it is essential.  
### How do I get a vpn? <a name="HowVPN"></a>
I am just going to copy and paste the same infomation from my [Privacy Guide](http://f3nici.xyz/Privacy/)  

Most VPNS are fine, however [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/) is easy to set up and I will show you how to get it for free.  

#### How to get a NordVPN account for free.
**WARNING** These accounts are stolen, however are useful **WARNING**  

It's pretty easy, just go to [H-gen](https://www.h-gen.xyz/) and choose NordVPN.

3) Copy and paste your account into NordVPN the format is User:Pass  
4) Here is the account I generated: ajvarela@bak.rr.com:Austin0822  

## Torrent Client <a name="client"></a>
For this guild I will be using [BiglyBT](https://www.biglybt.com/) (Formally Vuze) because its my client of choice, however many people use [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org)  

First download BiglyBT [Click here](https://files.biglybt.com/installer/BiglyBT_Stub_Installer.exe)  
Next run through the installer until you have it installed on your computer.  
Open it and you should be greeted with a menu like this:

Click on apply.  
Click on Tools then Options:  
![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/ZzzQ4Zc.png)  
Go to files and change the defult directory to your location of downloads.

Press save and exit the options.  
## How to torrent <a name="torrent"></a>
Go to [Solid Torrents](https://solidtorrents.net/) Or [1337x](https://www.1377x.to/)  
Find a movie or TV show you want  
Click on it and then press the magnet button:  
![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/SsAPyNx.png)  
Or

The torrent should then start downloading to your location that you set previously.  
## Seeding <a name="seeding"></a>
> Many newbies to piracy won’t know what seeding is and why it’s so praised in the community. Torrents are used instead of the file being downloaded from 1 source(ddl). When someone releases a torrent it will rely on you who has the file to help share that file via p2p (peer 2 peer). This is how corporations can’t get rid of torrents as there is no centralized source. However, if a torrent has no seeders, you cannot download that torrent as there is no one hosting that file anymore, the more seeders there are the faster a torrent will be (to a certain extent).
