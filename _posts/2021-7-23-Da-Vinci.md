# A complete guide to hacking the da vinci mini

## What is the problem? <a name="intro"></a>
So with a da Vinci mini you can't print using any filament, it makes you use theirs only by using NFC tags to check the rolls.

So by using this app I was able to program a NTAG213 NFC tag to show up as a fresh spool.

## So how do you do it? <a name="how"></a>
You have to use new tags that the machine hasn't seen and you can only program then too 200m or less.

Other than that it works flawlessly I was able to print and everything. I used the old casing for the tag to make sure the machine always read it and printed a separate roll for 1KG spools.

Just make sure you have an NFC capable phone and have NTAG213 tags.
